# spriteFix
Currently in process.
A little web based tool, for maping given sprite image to animation frames. There are some, lets say, not perfectly organized sprite sheets on Internet. So attempt is made to make it easy to map frames to sprite sheets or just fix them. At least that's an idea. 

Usage
-----
  For now, it useless. Still working on it from time to time. Just compile **Typescript** scripts in scripts folder. For example on Linux:
  
     `tsc -t es2015 ./scripts/*.ts`
     
  and open index.html in youre favorite browser. ( Please don't make IE8 your favorite ).
