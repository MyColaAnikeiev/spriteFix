# spriteFix
Currently in process.
A little web based tool, for maping given sprite image to animation frames. There are some, lets say, not perfectly organized sprite sheets on Internet. So attempt is made to make it easy to map frames to sprite sheets or fix existing sprite sheets. 

Usage
-----
  For now, it useless. Still working on it from time to time. Just compile **Typescript** in scripts folder and open index.html in youre favorite browser ( Well, you can try IE8 or something, but it won't end well. ).
